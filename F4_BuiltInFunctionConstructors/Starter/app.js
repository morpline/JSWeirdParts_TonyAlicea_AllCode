var s = new Number(3);
//s is not a primitive, it's a Number object.
//by using Number.protype, you can add functions and properties.
//you can't just use 3.isPositive, but you can use "John".length.
//that's because the interpreter puts strings in a String object automatically
//but it doesn't for other primitivves.
